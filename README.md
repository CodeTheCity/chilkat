TEAM : Richard Buchan

CHALLENGE : Socialise Events on Match the City database

RESULTS : 
Twitter page with associated Twitter API program.

Program obtains JSON data file from matchthecity URL, manipulates data, extracts Venue, Activity, Date and Time, Access Bing and/or Google API to get random image of activity and venue, add Aberdeen hash tag, and tweet. The URL to obtain the JSON data can be paramaterised so that only activities in the next few days are included, and the whole process can be scheduled to run at prescribed times.
